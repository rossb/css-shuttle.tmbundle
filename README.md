# CSS Shuttle

TextMate 2 bundle to supplement the default CSS bundle with gradients, transforms, animations, media queries and other modern CSS features and patterns.

Also includes snippets for basic CSS properties, aiming to maximise authorship speed based on experience with common usage patterns.

With a few exceptions vendor prefixes are excluded: use something like [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) rather than including vendor prefixes in your source stylesheets.

Generally excludes unstable or experimental CSS features that have yet to be widely implemented across browsers, unless they are stable enough to serve a purpose in production use today, e.g. as part of a progressive enhancement.
